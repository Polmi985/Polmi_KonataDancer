# Polmi's KonataDancer
Fun project that I made while learning SFML and C++. It's just dancing anime character(Konata Izumi) to a Bailando song. Also I added some settings for volume and size of the window.

## Controls
- Escape - quit the application
- F11 - settings

## Installation
Download whole project and then run PolmiKonataDancer.sln in Visual Studio
